# Meet Needs: Connecting Your Community

You and your neighbors face many challenges day in and day out. This is even more true in the age of Covid-19. 
At my church we wanted to find a way to help broker connections between people looking for a way to lend a hand and those
who could use some help. MeetNeeds is the result of this desire.

Remember also, black lives matter. If you are a white person like myself, chose to use your privilege as a shield to
protect the oppressed, and a microphone to amplify their voices and concerns. The power of Jesus is within all of the 
Church and by this power we can overturn systematic racism and bring justice and healing to the world.
## Connecting Community Members In An Age of Crisis

MeetNeeds allows people to register the needs they have. These can be trivial to substantial, monetary, or based on some
sort of labor. Whatever someone needs, they can request. People with resources available looking to put them to work can 
view a board of the communities needs and volunteer and commit to meeting any specific need. 

## People First

The last thing we want is for people to be taken advantage of or otherwise preyed upon. Any user can submit a need that 
anonymously shared publicly. Whenever someone commits to meeting a need, an email is sent to a real person to evaluate 
the Meeter and make follow up contact if necessary. On then does contact information get shared between someone with a
need and someone looking to meet that need.

## Dependencies
I started building this with [GoDotEnv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv) and [env](https://github.com/caarlos0/env) to manage environment variables.
[MailGun](https://mailgun.com) is how I send emails. If you want to close this and run it yourself, you will need a Mailgun 
account. They offer a very generous free tier and their Golang library is solid.
